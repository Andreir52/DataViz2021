# DataViz2021

This dataset contains a large amount of rows and features to explore.

Columns are mapped with their text strings from a lookup table.

Ideas for our project (Inspired from the dataset author). Plots, Heat maps, Graphs for the following:

     How does the weather impact the number or severity of an accident?
     Does driver age has an effect on the number of accident?
     What is the relation between hour, day, week, month with number of fatal accident?
     Are certain car models safer than others?
     Is the social class of a casualty dependant of the accident severity?
     How does the power of a car impact the severity of an accident? 
     Most accident-prone location in the UK
     Correlation between weather and car control loss (Skidding and Overturning)
     
Predictions:

     Can we predict the probability of a fatal accident (based on specific input features such as age, location, car engine capacity)?
